## Description
  Study Buddy is a mobile application that demystifies the process
  of finding study partners. Study Buddy allows users to make and
  view postings for study groups. Users can search
  for others currently studying the same material around
  them, and then they can chat each other to arrange the
  logistics of an in-person meetup.
  
## Background
  It is sometimes difficult for college students to find people
  to study with. The format of college lectures discourages
  interaction between students, which can put a huge damper
  on students who prefer to study with others. Some people
  prefer to study with others, but find it difficult
  to network with people in their classes. So, we conducted
  significant research to make sure our app was as helpful as
  possible, and then we created it to the best of our ability.
