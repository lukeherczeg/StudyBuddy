## Description
  Study Buddy is a mobile application that facilitates finding
  study partners. Study Buddy will allow users to make and
  view postings for study groups. Users will be able to search
  for others currently studying the same material around
  them. They will then be able to join a chat to arrange the
  logistics of an in-person meetup.
  
## Background
  It is sometimes difficult for college students to find people
  to study with. The format of college lectures discourages
  interaction between students, which can put a huge damper
  on students who prefer to study with others. Some people
  prefer to study with others, but find it difficult
  to network with people in their classes. Thus, we decided to
  design our app around finding study partners.
